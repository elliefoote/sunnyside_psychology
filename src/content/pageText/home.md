Are you fed up with something in your life? Are
the ways that you have been feeling, thinking or behaving no longer working
for you? Do you want things to be different?  
<br>
It's easy to get stuck doing things the same way that we've always done them
and, at the same time, wishing for a better outcome. There's a certain
comfort that comes with keeping things as they are, even if it's hurting us.
If you find yourself in this situation, remember â€“ If nothing changes...
then nothing changes.  
<br>
Reaching out for help can be daunting. Sunny Side Psychology makes it easier
to start the conversation by offering psychology sessions via telehealth, so
you can see a psychologist without leaving your home. This makes mental
health support more accessible for people who find it difficult to attend
appointments in person because they have a disability, live in a rural or
remote area, have a busy schedule, or simply because they prefer to speak to
someone online.
