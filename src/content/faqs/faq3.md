question: How do I get a referral?

Speak to your doctor about your concerns so they can prepare a psychologist referral and relevant care plan (e.g. MHTP). You will generally need to book a longer appointment for this. You can also get a psychologist referral at your Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health check.
